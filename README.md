# SMoS - Structured Messaging over Serial

SMoS is a client/server REST based messaging protocol, originally intended as a mechanism to encapsulate data and it's context when transmitted over a serial link but can be used over other socket connections (e.g. websocket, TCP, UDP)
SMoS is a way of conveying binary data in a form of a hex string. It's structure was inspired by the [Intel Hex Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX).
